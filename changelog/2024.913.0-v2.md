A small release since I've not finished a lot of the large features I wanted to get out sooner, but since there's a few bugs I wanted to get these fixed as I'm away next week.
Quite a few things in this release have had a rework, and while I've tested them they're usually hardware dependant, so give them a test and let me know if anything's wrong.

## App
- Rewrote tracked device handler
  - This now allows users to assign roles to their tracked devices in the SteamVR tab of the settings, allowing modules to just grab, for example, the left foot.
- Fixed Start with SteamVR not working
  - Let me know if this is still broken for some people. Fixing this depends on what's already been added to your SteamVR manifest lists
- Fixed clip variables sometimes erroring in Unicode edge cases
- Handle deserialisation of object types better
- Changed runtime view to take in a type instead of an instance
  - You're now required to make the view have a constructor of (Module)
  - You're now required to initialise the runtime view in OnPreLoad
- Add more runtime validation
- Improved speech detection
  - This returns the partial and final results
  - The silence threshold is currently set at 15% which should work fine as long as the microphone volume is at 100% which all VR headsets should be at
- Added back light theme
  - For now this still requires an app restart to apply

## Official Modules
- Clear parameter cache on avatar change for Counter to avoid parameters with the same name having different types
- Updated SteamVRStats to use the new role system
- Updated SpeechToText to new upgraded speech interface
