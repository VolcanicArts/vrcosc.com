        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After over a year of work, V2 is finally here. A lot has changed, so brace yourself for a read!</p>
<p>As there has been many changes, and there are a lot of differences in what modules should be used now, take a read of the upgrade document <a href="https://volcanicarts.github.io/docs/v2/upgrading">here</a>.</p>
<p>As always, if you need help, join the <a href="https://vrcosc.com/discord" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord Server</a></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="whats-changed">What's Changed?<a href="https://volcanicarts.github.io/changelog/2024.1208.0#whats-changed" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What's Changed?" title="Direct link to What's Changed?">​</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>UI framework<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>V2 is written in WPF, meaning that it's now written in a proper desktop framework that Windows supports</li>
<li>This enables for clearer text, faster UI, lower memory usage, lower storage usage, lower CPU usage, and NO GPU usage!</li>
<li>This also allows for opening multiple windows so that the UI can be less cramped</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>OSCQuery<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>VRCOSC now supports connecting to VRChat via OSCQuery</li>
<li>If you don't know what OSCQuery is, that's fine! It just means less port errors if you're running other apps</li>
<li>If you were previously using the router, you now shouldn't need it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Profiles<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Everything you do in the app, aside from global settings, is now inside a profile</li>
<li>This means you can now make different profiles for different things</li>
<li>Profiles are able to be copied if needed</li>
<li>Profiles are also able to be linked to avatars, meaning if you change into an avatar the linked profile will be changed to, automating profile switching!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Modules<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>The SDK has been completely revamped to be more stable and resilient</li>
<li>Modules are now installed directly from GitHub, and the official modules aren't packaged with the app. This allows for modules to be updated without the app updating</li>
<li>Anyone can now publish a module package on GitHub and have it appear inside the app for everyone to use!</li>
<li>Modules have had a massive facelift with clearer UI for their settings and parameters</li>
<li>You can now import/export configs for easier sharing, and for putting alongside prefabs so installing them even easier</li>
<li>Compatible prefabs are also linked</li>
<li>Where applicable, there are also links to the docs for certain modules where extra information is useful</li>
<li>Parameters are also now able to be disabled, if you don't want to see certain parameters</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Run View<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>The run view has had a massive upgrade with several notable features</li>
<li>The first tab, runtime, allows module developers to create custom UI to be placed on the run view for users to use. These are meant to be for settings that can be dynamically populated during runtime</li>
<li>The second tab, avatar, is the incoming and outgoing parameter list that was in V1</li>
<li>The third tab, ChatBox, is a preview of the ChatBox when the timeline is active, meaning you don't have to go into VRChat to see if things are working</li>
<li>The ChatBox tab also allows you to type live text into the ChatBox to override the timeline</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>ChatBox V4<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>ChatBox V4, also now just the ChatBox Animation System, is an upgraded version of ChatBox V3</li>
<li>The timeline now allows you to reorder clips by dragging them between layers</li>
<li>Module developers can now add dynamic states (ones that aren't available when the app starts), meaning for things like the Counter module, different states and events per counter!</li>
<li>States and events have had a facelift, allowing for custom settings per state and event. Things like showing the typing indicator, some background tricks to "hide" it, and more to come!</li>
<li>The biggest change has been to how variables are referenced. They're now in a list, where you use <code>{i}</code> in the textbox to reference them, where <code>i</code> is the number next to the variable</li>
<li>Variables are now instanced, meaning the module provides some raw data, and you choose how it's formatted</li>
<li>TickerTape is no longer a module, as every variable can ticker tape!</li>
<li>There's also some custom variables that don't require a module to work. If you think you know of something that would be useful, suggest it</li>
<li>You'll also see the clips and states/events outline in yellow. This is to show you which clip and state/event is currently active</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Speech To Text<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>The speech engine is now global rather than being per module, and has changed from VOSK to Whisper</li>
<li>Whisper has many upsides, being that it's faster, more accurate, has punctuation, and uses less resources</li>
<li>Since it's global, you need to go into the app's settings and install a model</li>
<li>In the settings you can also mess with the different sliders to get recognition to work better for you. The default settings should be fine for most users</li>
<li>If you have a Vulkan-capable GPU, it will also be used where possible to speed up recognition. It won't use it if VRChat is taking up all your GPU though!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>SteamVR<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>SteamVR integration has been given an upgrade, allowing modules to reference specific roles for trackers rather than having a list</li>
<li>This requires users to go into the app's settings and assign roles to all the devices that have connected to their SteamVR instance</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Along with everything above there's countless smaller changes, improvements, and QoL features!</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="thank-you">Thank You!<a href="https://volcanicarts.github.io/changelog/2024.1208.0#thank-you" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Thank You!" title="Direct link to Thank You!">​</a></h2>
<p>Thank you to everyone that's supported V2's development over the past year. It's been a lot of effort to get things right, and I'm very excited for the future of VRCOSC.</p>
<p>A big thank you to the beta testers who were daily-driving V2 and reporting bugs, and a massive thank you to the whole community who've still been using VRCOSC!</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a tentative <strong>release candidate</strong> to replace V1 with V2. If you have any suggestions, problems, or bugs, now is the time to report them.
All the V1 modules are now transferred over to V2, or have V2 counterparts in the form of other functionality or modules that have superseded them.
I'll be doing extensive testing over the next few weeks to make sure everything is working, but for those of you that use the less-used modules, I'd be grateful to hear that things are working as expected.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A small release since I've not finished a lot of the large features I wanted to get out sooner, but since there's a few bugs I wanted to get these fixed as I'm away next week.
Quite a few things in this release have had a rework, and while I've tested them they're usually hardware dependant, so give them a test and let me know if anything's wrong.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="app">App<a href="https://volcanicarts.github.io/changelog/2024.913.0-v2#app" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to App" title="Direct link to App">​</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Rewrote tracked device handler<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>This now allows users to assign roles to their tracked devices in the SteamVR tab of the settings, allowing modules to just grab, for example, the left foot.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed Start with SteamVR not working<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Let me know if this is still broken for some people. Fixing this depends on what's already been added to your SteamVR manifest lists</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed clip variables sometimes erroring in Unicode edge cases</li>
<li>Handle deserialisation of object types better</li>
<li>Changed runtime view to take in a type instead of an instance<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>You're now required to make the view have a constructor of (Module)</li>
<li>You're now required to initialise the runtime view in OnPreLoad</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Add more runtime validation</li>
<li>Improved speech detection<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>This returns the partial and final results</li>
<li>The silence threshold is currently set at 15% which should work fine as long as the microphone volume is at 100% which all VR headsets should be at</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added back light theme<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>For now this still requires an app restart to apply</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Clear parameter cache on avatar change for Counter to avoid parameters with the same name having different types</li>
<li>Updated SteamVRStats to use the new role system</li>
<li>Updated SpeechToText to new upgraded speech interface</li>

<ul>
<li>TONS of UI improvements<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Little things like text placement, hovering over draggable components, colour changes, etc etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Standardisation of the UI<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>A lot of the custom components I've made have been redesigned and reimplemented in a way that's useful for module developers, but also has standardised app-wide behaviour</li>
<li>More of the app, like scrolling, should also work with touchscreen and touchscreen emulation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Changes from <code>Page</code> to <code>UserControl</code> for runtime pages and custom settings<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Modules that implement a runtime view or should now use <code>SetRuntimeView()</code> and their <code>Page</code> should be changed to a <code>UserControl</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added info button to modules that allows for linking to docs pages</li>
<li>Added prefabs button to modules to allow for linking to prefab downloads</li>
<li>Reimplemented most of the main pages to function better and add more visual flare</li>
<li>Added manual input for ChatBox</li>
<li>Fixed OpenVR throwing an error when SteamVR wasn't installed</li>
<li>Attempted to fix UTF16 characters not scrolling in clip variables correctly</li>
<li>Added bounce mode to all clip variables</li>
<li>Improved debug panel to make it expandable</li>
<li>Improved UX for bypassing ChatBox validation</li>
<li>Attempted to fix start with SteamVR<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>This one is a little more tricky and will require more work to get it working on the rest of people's computers (thanks Valve)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Allow clips to be copy-pasted</li>
<li>Attempted to fix WindowsMediaProvider race condition</li>
<li>Added start in tray functionality</li>
<li>Added metadata parameters to know which modules are currently running</li>
<li>Added control parameters to enable/disable the chatbox globally, and enable/disable certain layers</li>
<li>Added PasswordTextBox</li>
<li>Fixed some clip variables formatting incorrectly at extremes</li>
<li>Changed custom settings to include the module as a reference<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>The constructor for a custom setting's UserControl now requires (YourModule module, YourCustomSetting setting)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Removed RequestSerialisation from settings<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>This was too complicated to force module developers to implement a callback for every single setting, so it's been removed in favour of saving when the settings window closes. VRCOSC will still attempt to save as often as possible to reduce dataloss in the event of a crash</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Silenced some exceptions that users don't need to care about</li>
<li>Ignore failed OSCQuery attempts<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>VRChat likes to leave the port in mDNS apparently, even after the game is closed, which caused VRCOSC to crash trying to contact a non-existent game</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed <code>Observable&lt;T&gt;</code> sometimes not notifying of changes</li>
<li>Created KeybindPicker</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="official-modules">Official Modules<a href="https://volcanicarts.github.io/changelog/2024.812.0-v2#official-modules" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Official Modules" title="Direct link to Official Modules">​</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Create Keybinds module<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>This is a replacement for the Discord module</li>
<li>Add an instance, name it, enter the parameter(s) you want to trigger the keybinds. Add a new keybind, click on the component, it will turn red to record. Now you can press any key with any modifiers (ctrl, shift, alt, win) and it will record the presses.</li>
<li>To have this work successfully with Discord, you'll need to set the keybinds in Discord. To recreate the Discord module, go into Discord's keybinds in their app and add new keybinds for mute and deafen</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added Maths module</li>
<li>Added module info docs links where applicable</li>
<li>Added prefab download links where applicable</li>
<li>Updated a ton of custom UI to use the new standardised components</li>
<li>Added a button for obtaining an access token to Pulsoid</li>
<li>Changed textboxes to password textboxes where applicable</li>
<li>Moved max duration and max intensity from global to per shocker group for PiShock</li>
<li>Moved float threshold to being per counter and added an int threshold for Counter</li>
<li>Added milestones to Counter</li>
<li>Added outgoing parameters to Stopwatch</li>

<li>Fixed any Heartrate module not stopping correctly if the websocket was already disconnected</li>
<li>Fixed importing module configs breaking the app while modules were running</li>

<ul>
<li>Added Stopwatch module</li>
<li>Added Leash module<!-- -->

<ul>
<li>Changed to Whisper<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>This is a replacement for VOSK, the previous speech engine</li>
<li>You should find this is more accurate, and I've done my best to fine tune the settings for it but you may find that you need to adjust the confidence yourself depending on your microphone quality</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Removed AvatarModule and ChatBoxModule<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Given that VRChat won't be adding world OSC for quite some time I've elected to remove the inheritance of modules for the SDK</li>
<li>Developers now just need to have their modules extend Module</li>
<li>This does have the benefit of meaning if world OSC comes out then avatar modules and world modules won't be separated</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Further improved module package and module loading to prevent errors and nicely present them</li>
<li>Removed a bunch of dependencies to make installer and installed size smaller</li>
<li>Rewrote WindowsMediaProvider<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Those that were having problems on Windows 11, I've done my best to alleviate the problem but it seems to be a Windows 11 thing</li>
<li>Anyone else who was having errors before should find things are a lot more stable</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added an option for ChatBox states and events to use a minimal background<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>This uses some character tricks to force the ChatBox background to be skinny without affecting text</li>
<li>This is a lot less intrusive if you have a permanent ChatBox so give it a shot!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added OSCQuery parameter type and name retrieving to the SDK</li>
<li>Added Progress clip variable<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>The Media module's progress resolution has been removed in favour of this new variable</li>
<li>This gives you the option of customising exactly how the progress visual looks as well as just showing a percentage</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Changed the name of built-in Text variable to Custom Text for clarity</li>
<li>Fixed displaying identical names for the microphone input when using virtual audio cables</li>
<li>General UI improvements</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Updated heartrate modules to SDK behaviour changes</li>
<li>Updated Speech To Text to handle new speech engine</li>
<li>Updated Media to new Windows Media Provider</li>
<li>Updated all modules inline with removal of AvatarModule and ChatBoxModule</li>
