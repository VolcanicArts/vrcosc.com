## App
- Rewrote settings view
    - All the settings sections have had a UI overhaul
    - The speech view now have a way of installing multiple models and to debug if your microphone is working
    - The debug view now has more debug options and the module debug log viewable
- Fixed switching themes needing a restart of the app
- Fixed module packages not being able to import native DLLs
- Reverted forks of packages being allowed in the package listing
    - This caused duplicates of packages to appear if the vrcosc.json file wasn't changed
- Fixed a package manager case when a package only has pre-releases and auto-update was attempted
- Changed the updater to only run after 10 mins has passed
    - This should improve start-up times for those that restart the app often
- Fixed a crash when switching update channels to a channel with no releases
- Added a receiving mode to the router for those that want to route other apps into VRChat
- Fixed default VRChat parameter errors being shown to the user
    - Sometimes they're wrong on a public avatar, so we'll just ignore them now

- Added the ability for developers to set setting values
- Changed some module methods to public for use from other classes
- Fixed an issue where changing an int textbox to a slider didn't convert properly
