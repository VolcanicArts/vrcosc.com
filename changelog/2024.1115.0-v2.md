This is the 2nd (and hopefully final) **release candidate** for V2 replacing V1!
You may notice that things fail to load correctly in this version. Refresh your package cache using the refresh button and then re-install the official modules and it should be fine!

## App
- Package manager improvements
  - Added installed version to the installed dropdown when it's a pre-release and pre-release is disallowed
  - Highlighted pre-releases as orange
  - Allow module packages to contain ZIPs
    - This allows module developers to publish ZIPs to their release which will get downloaded and unpacked automatically
    - Raw DLLs are still supported, but the ZIP method is better for security and integrity if you have multiple files
- Fixed Heartrate module staying in the connected ChatBox state
- Fixed Heartrate module staying on the last receiving value for the value variable
- Fully qualify states when evaluating clips to fix 2 or more modules being active and having the same state names
- Added the router to advanced settings to hide it behind a toggle
- Added validation checks when creating settings groups
- Fixed clip names being cut-off when the window or clip is too small
- Fixed OSCQuery not receiving parameters correctly
- Changed the VRChat log reader to only read logs that have occurred after the modules have started
- Vastly improved the VRChat log reader's speed
- Fixed the current avatar's config being loaded up twice
- Hide custom endpoints behind the Use Custom Endpoints toggle
- Added a toggle for auto-updating non-pre-release packages after an app update
- Improved key simulator
- Added an auto install model button for the Whisper model
- Added the ability to follow the default microphone instead of having to manually switch
- Improved handling of the audio buffer
- Improved speech handler to remove text that goes over the limit of the ChatBox
- Moved the manual ChatBox input to above the timeline and improved its behaviour
- Fixed start in tray not working correctly
- Fixed some odd grammar
- Added a File Reader built-in variable
  - This reads a file and puts its text contents into the ChatBox

## Official Modules
- Added play on instance transfer to Media module
- Allow Keybinds module to pick between press and hold/release
  - Press means that when the parameter becomes true it will press the keybind for 50 milliseconds and then release
  - Hold/Release means that it will hold the keybind when the parameter is true, and release when the parameter is false
- Fix PiShock response formatting
- Fixed float textboxes not allowing floats to be entered properly
- Fixed some titles and descriptions
