This is a tentative **release candidate** to replace V1 with V2. If you have any suggestions, problems, or bugs, now is the time to report them.
All the V1 modules are now transferred over to V2, or have V2 counterparts in the form of other functionality or modules that have superseded them.
I'll be doing extensive testing over the next few weeks to make sure everything is working, but for those of you that use the less-used modules, I'd be grateful to hear that things are working as expected.

## App
- Speech To Text improvements
  - You can now specify a volume boost amount to help Whisper hear you when your mic is set to a lower level for other applications
  - If you have a modern GPU that supports Vulkan, Whisper will now run using Vulkan to speed up recognition to near-instant recognition
  - When you switch your microphone in the settings you no longer need to restart the modules
- Updated parameter listing
  - Parameters can now be disabled for those of you that want to customise exactly which parameters get sent
  - The formatting for the list now better handles small window sizes
- ChatBox variable improvements
  - Int and Float variables can now do character mapping
  - This allows you to do things like have a heartrate character get more aggressive the higher your heartrate goes
  - Int variables have a minimum and maximum value. The list of characters (or words) gets linearly interpolated through
  - Float variables are locked between 0 and 1. The list of characters (or words) gets linearly interpolated through
- Added the Timer global variable to format a TimeSpan that counts to a specific DateTime
- Small graphics and formatting improvements

## Official Modules
- Added voice commands to PiShock
- Reworked how the max duration and intensity work for PiShock groups
- Removed Leash module
  - It may return at some point but I want the V2 release to be at parity with V1
- Removed Timer module in favour of the new Timer global variable
- Added Voice Commands module
- Reworked Maths module to change how parameters are retrieved to allow parameters with slashes in their names
  - You now need to surround the parameter's name with `{}`, and it will be replaced with the parameter's literal value
  - If a parameter's value cannot be found, the equation will be aborted
