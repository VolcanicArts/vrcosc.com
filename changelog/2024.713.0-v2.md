## App
- Changed to Whisper
  - This is a replacement for VOSK, the previous speech engine
  - You should find this is more accurate, and I've done my best to fine tune the settings for it but you may find that you need to adjust the confidence yourself depending on your microphone quality
- Removed AvatarModule and ChatBoxModule
  - Given that VRChat won't be adding world OSC for quite some time I've elected to remove the inheritance of modules for the SDK
  - Developers now just need to have their modules extend Module
  - This does have the benefit of meaning if world OSC comes out then avatar modules and world modules won't be separated
- Further improved module package and module loading to prevent errors and nicely present them
- Removed a bunch of dependencies to make installer and installed size smaller
- Rewrote WindowsMediaProvider
  - Those that were having problems on Windows 11, I've done my best to alleviate the problem but it seems to be a Windows 11 thing
  - Anyone else who was having errors before should find things are a lot more stable
- Added an option for ChatBox states and events to use a minimal background
  - This uses some character tricks to force the ChatBox background to be skinny without affecting text
  - This is a lot less intrusive if you have a permanent ChatBox so give it a shot!
- Added OSCQuery parameter type and name retrieving to the SDK
- Added Progress clip variable
  - The Media module's progress resolution has been removed in favour of this new variable
  - This gives you the option of customising exactly how the progress visual looks as well as just showing a percentage
- Changed the name of built-in Text variable to Custom Text for clarity
- Fixed displaying identical names for the microphone input when using virtual audio cables
- General UI improvements

## Official Modules
