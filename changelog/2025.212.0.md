## App
- Added support for Dollies
    - Dollies are currently in the VRChat open-beta
    - A new Dolly view has been added where you can control the Dolly from outside of VRChat
    - You can also save, load, and import Dolly files
    - This Dolly view is profiled, so you can have different profiles for different camera operators
- Overhauled package management
    - Packages are now checked in parallel, decreasing app load times
    - Packages are now installed in parallel, decreasing install times
- Overhauled connection system
    - There are now 3 connection modes. Local, LAN, and custom
    - 99% of people will only ever need to use Local
    - LAN is for when you want to connect to VRChat on a different device
    - Custom is for setting up custom send and receive addresses and ports
    - Documentation can be found here: http://localhost:3000/docs/v2/connecting
