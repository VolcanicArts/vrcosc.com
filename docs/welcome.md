# Welcome
Welcome to VRCOSC's Docs. Here you can find the documentation on how to use the app, official modules, and making your own modules to distribute in the app.
Feel free to reach out on the Discord server if you need more guidance, or feel that parts of these docs aren't as well-written as they could be.

If you'd like to make changes to these docs yourself, you can fork the repo [here](https://github.com/VolcanicArts/vrcosc.com).

:::info

Most of the docs from the wiki have been transferred to the V1 section. V2 is the next version of the app and is in beta. You can test it out by downloading the zip file inside the v2-releases channel on the Discord server by getting the V2 Beta role.
